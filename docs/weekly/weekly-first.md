Introducing Fuse for Cross-Platform App Development

[https://code.tutsplus.com/articles/introducing-fuse-for-cross-platform-app-development–cms-30793](https://code.tutsplus.com/articles/introducing-fuse-for-cross-platform-app-development–cms-30793)

Fuse is a platform for developing cross-platform apps with UX Markup and JavaScript. It’s in the same category as React Native and NativeScript, but its main selling point is in the provision of tools that enable developers and designers collaborate in real time. Fuse uses UX Markup, an XML-based language which provides the building blocks for the UI. It also allows you to specify how the different components would behave when users interact with them, thus the name “UX”.
